Analysis on PM2.5 data on Chile. 
Project developed for the course "STA250 - Data Science for International Development", UC Davis - Winter 2023.



# Data Sources

* **Air pollution**: Satellite data . PM2.5 estimates globally at a 0.01°x0.01° (0.01°~1.11km) resolution. Data available at yearly and monthly level. Data comes from [`Van Donkelaar, A., Martin, R. V., Brauer, M. & Boys, B. L. Use of satellite observations for long-term exposure assessment of global concentrations of fine particulate matter. Environ. Health Perspect. 123, 135–143 (2015)`](https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/datasets/surface-pm2-5/)

* **Air pollution Ground data**: [`SINCA-National Air Quality Information System`] (https://sinca.mma.gob.cl/)
	* Hourly and daily monitor data of PM2.5 concentrations. Multiple monitor stations with data available across Chile used to validate the satellite data.
	* Data is obtained through scripts developed from another [`project`] (https://github.com/pmbusch/Reportes-SINCA)
